## Project Objective
The Amazon Sales Overview dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive, interactive analysis of sales data across different dimensions, including country, product, and performance indicators. This project aims to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions by offering insights into key metrics such as total sales, profit, customers, and orders. The dashboard provides both high-level summaries and detailed views, allowing for flexibility in exploring trends and tracking performance against set targets.

## Overview Section
The Overview section serves as the landing page of the dashboard. It includes:
- Year, Month, and Date Slicers: Allows users to filter data by specific timeframes.
- Interactive Map: Displays sales data by country. Users can hover or click on countries to view sales-related metrics.
- Key Measures: Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Customers, and Total Orders are displayed for a quick snapshot of the business's performance.

- In-page navigation allows users to switch between metrics.

## Performance Section
This section uses a Key Performance Influencer visual to analyze sales trends:
- Users can select the Increase or Decrease option to view countries that are contributing to higher or lower sales.
- The visual shows which countries have sales above or below average. For example, the USA has more sales than average, while countries like Canada, Netherlands, and Germany perform below average.
